# StudentPlanner

Students face a lot of stress when they are unplanned and unprepared for a task. Often, they are involved in too many academic and co-curricular activities. 

As a result of this there is an overwhelming numbers of tasks to be competed at any point in time and new ones keep getting added. Hence very good time management adn plannign are needed to accomplish this.

In addition, many students have trouble remembering tasks that they need to complete. As they pile up, there is a large chance that the student may end up forgetting about some of these tasks and missing the deadline.
